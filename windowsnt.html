   <li class="i2" id="liil">Released in 1993 Windows NT revolutionized the world of operating systems as Microsofts creation. It was a building block for the Windows. It was designed to cater to business and professional users by offering new features, enhanced security and exceptional stability. One of its standout features was multitasking, which allowed multiple programs to run simultaneously without causing any disruptions. Windows NT also had a 32 bit architecture that improved performance and memory management compared to its previous versions that operated on a 16 bit system.

    Among its advancements Windows NT introduced the NTFS file system that brought enhanced reliability, security measures and support for file sizes when compared to the older FAT file system. It also incorporated an integrated networking stack making it a good choice for enterprise environments. The security features of Windows NT included access control lists (ACLs) and user level permissions setting standards for computing.
    
    In its versions Windows NT prioritized functionality over looks, with a different appearance geared towards business needs. However as new versions rolled out over time its user interface underwent transformations to become visually appealing and user friendly.
    
    Eventually this led to the release of Windows XP, which brought together user elements from Windows 95/98 and the stability and security of Windows NT. This integration resulted in the merging of consumer and professional Windows operating systems, into a codebase shaping the development of Microsofts operating system.
